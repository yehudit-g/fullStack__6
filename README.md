# Fullstack_6th_Project - Creating a Local Server with MySQL Database

## Introduction
Welcome to my sixth fullstack project! This project aims to replicate the functionality of jsonplaceholder.typicode.com by creating a custom server with defined routes, integrating a MySQL database for data storage, and developing a client-side application to interact with this server.

## Project Overview
In this project, I am building a fullstack application comprising two main components:
- **Server-side Application:** A custom Node.js server that handles HTTP requests and responses, defining routes for CRUD operations on various resources such as posts, users, and comments.
- **Client-side Application:** A web-based client that sends requests to the local server and displays the retrieved information in a user-friendly interface.

## Key Features
- **Custom Server Development:** Using Node.js and Express.js to create a robust backend server capable of handling RESTful API requests.
- **MySQL Database Integration:** Setting up a MySQL database to store and manage persistent data for resources like posts, users, and comments.
- **Client-Server Interaction:** Implementing asynchronous communication between the client and server using HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
- **User Interface Development:** Designing a responsive and intuitive client-side interface to showcase data fetched from the local server.

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js & Express.js:** For building the backend server and defining API routes.
- **MySQL:** As the relational database management system (RDBMS) for storing and managing structured data.
- **JavaScript (ES6+):** For server-side and client-side programming, including asynchronous operations and DOM manipulation.
- **HTML & CSS:** For structuring the client-side interface and styling elements to enhance user experience.

## Project Goals
The primary goals of this project include:
- **Creating a Fullstack Application:** Gain practical experience in developing both server-side and client-side components of a web application.
- **Implementing RESTful API:** Design and implement RESTful API routes for CRUD operations to manage data stored in the MySQL database.
- **Database Management:** Setup and utilize MySQL for efficient data storage and retrieval, ensuring data integrity and security.
- **Enhancing User Experience:** Develop a responsive and visually appealing client interface to present data fetched from the local server effectively.

This project represents a significant step towards mastering fullstack development skills, focusing on backend server implementation, database management, and seamless client-server interaction.
